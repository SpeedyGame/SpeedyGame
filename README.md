### Hello. My name is Steven Mensah. I'm an undergraduate student at Knox College, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in either Music, Japanese, or both.
I do not have much coding experience as of now. I've messed around in video game engines such as Unity, RenPy, and took a Web Development class in highschool
(which you can view). It's only until the start of college that I started to learn more about programming and know what I'm typing on the screen and why. I hope to put up
some of my personal projects here (mainly game dev projects).
